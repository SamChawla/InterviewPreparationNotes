## ML Notes


What is Machine Learning?

    Machine learning (ML) is a modern software development technique and a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to solve problems by using examples of real-world data. It allows computers to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed to do so.

Within machine learning there are several different kinds of tasks or techniques:

- In `supervised learning`, every training sample from the dataset has a corresponding label or output value associated with it. As a result, the algorithm learns to predict labels or output values. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.
    
- In `unsupervised learning`, there are no labels for the training data. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn the underlying patterns or distributions that govern the data. We will explore this in-depth in this lesson.

- In `reinforcement learning`, the algorithm figures out which actions to take in a situation to maximize a reward (in the form of a number) on the way to reaching a specific goal. This is a completely different approach than supervised and unsupervised learning.

`In machine learning, the problem solver abstracts away part of their solution as a flexible component called a model, and uses a special program called a model training algorithm to adjust that model to real-world data. The result is a trained model which can be used to predict outcomes that are not part of the data set used to train it.`
