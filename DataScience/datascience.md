# Analysis vs analytics

- Analysis and analytics are not two interchangeable terms.

*Analysis* – Dividing data into digestible components that are easier to understand and examining how different parts relate to each other. Performed on past data, explaining why the story ended in the way that it did. We want to explain ‘how’ and ‘why’ something happened.

*Analytics* – Explores the future. The application of logical and computational reasoning to the component parts obtained in an analysis. In doing this, you are looking for patterns and exploring what you can do with them in the future.

We can have:
- Qualitative analytics – using intuition and experience in conjunction with analysis to plan your next business move
- Quantitative analytics – applying formulas and algorithms to numbers that you have gathered from your analysis.
